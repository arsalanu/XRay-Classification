Database used: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

**Convolutional Neural Network**: Binary discrete classification model to detect whether patient X-Rays display pneumonia or are healthy. The model was trained and developed using Keras on Tensorflow, and monitored using Tensorboard. A visualisation of images and their detected category is also shown using an OpenCV visual.

-- A more detailed description will be placed here, still working on accuracy and good generalisation
